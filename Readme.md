# Keyboard Navigator
Keyboard Navigator is a simple javascript library through which developers can implement tabbing in the web applications either by their own strategy or by utilizing that which is provided by library by configuring it to any extent.

Keyboard Navigator provides navigation strategy on using Tab key and Arrow Keys. 

Web Applications developed using frontend libraries tend to update DOM frequently through template bindings, such applications tend to loose focus if DOM updates. Keyboard Navigator provides a strategy to persist focus in such scenarios by exploiting the XPath reference to elements.
